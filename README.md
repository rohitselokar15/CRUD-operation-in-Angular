# User Management System

## Overview
This project is a simple User Management System built using Angular and Express.js. It allows users to add their details (name, age, and salary) through a form and view a list of all added users. The data is stored in a JSON file (`user.json`) on the server.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular**: A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **RxJS**: A library for reactive programming using Observables, making it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.
- **JSON**: The data format used to store user information in a file.

## Features
- **Add User**: Users can fill out a form with their name, age, and salary to add themselves to the system.
- **List Users**: Users can view a list of all previously added users.
- **Data Persistence**: User data is saved in a JSON file on the server, allowing for data persistence between sessions.
